## Faculty Brainstorming 
  To be added...   There is a lecture on this topic, we should schedule this to be just after that lecture.

##Possible topics
Some of these topics might deserve a full-blown text description.  

Others might just be a mention of some feature in the spirit of: "did you even know you can do X?  Go look it up, it will change your life...".    Maybe there could be a list of these and the student assignment is to choose and go figure out `n` of them and implement in your VS Code setup.   

- Installation - point to something
- Why you ONLY want it on your local machine - the ssh is too good to waste time otherwise and you will never keep the various versions in synch in terms of extensions and settings.
- The ssh remote capability for just editing and the like
- Debugging using the ssh remote.  Detail Python vs. C++ is there are significant differences.
- Any advantages of the local terminal instead of one on the remote machine?  Yes, big advantages, detail those.
- Extensions - how they work, how to install them, cool ones we know of they will not have  thought of...
- Writing your own keyboard macros.  Students likely don't need this, it is for me!  I have figured it out twice now and then forget how to do it by the next time I try next :-)

What else?
