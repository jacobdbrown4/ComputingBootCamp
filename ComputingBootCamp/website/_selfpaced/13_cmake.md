## About CMake

TBD

## Install

The version of *cmake* that is installed via *apt* is usually quite old.  There are [many ways](https://askubuntu.com/questions/355565/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-cmake-from-the-command-line) to get a newer version of *cmake*, although the easiest is to grab it from the Python package manager (*pip*) where it is kept fairly up to date:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade cmake
```
